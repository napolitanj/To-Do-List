Get 'er Done

This application is for The Odin Project's "To Do List" Project. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate proficiency with webpack, npm, modules, object oriented programming, etc.

Basic functionality has been added. The user can create new projects, click on them in the menu causing them to appear in the interface, and then add new items to the list. 

Needs:

- Save projects + items when switching between them.

Most of the foundation is complete. New items can be added to the list and the interface functions as it should. Working on appending items to the current project and rendering them that way, and allowing the interface to change between projects.
