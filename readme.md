Get 'er Done

This application is for The Odin Project's "To Do List" Project. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate proficiency with webpack, npm, modules, object oriented programming, etc.

-----------
Version 1.1
-----------

Some styling changed, code cleanup. Can no longer add to Today project - instead today simply renders any items added to projects that are for todays date.

-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

The application functions as it should on a basic level. The application can:

- Add and delete projects
- Add and delete tasks for each project (Title, description, date)
- Append tasks to "Today" if the date is appropriate
- Edit a project name
- Remove items from "Today" if parent project does not exist.

So far after some testing no errors seem to be present.

Needs:

- Code Cleanup
- The ability to set priority
- Add a feature that expands a task to see / edit details
- Highlight current project in the menu
- Style

-----------
Version 0.9
-----------

The application is mostly in working order. This week has been removed. The folder for "Today" automatically adds any tasks that are scheduled for the current day.

Needs:

- Ability to edit item
- updates list when item is deleted from today
- style
- remove item from today when parent project does not exist

-----------
Version 0.8
-----------

The application allows users to delete items.

Needs:
- Ability to edit items.
- Automatically creates folders for today + this week based on date.
- Ability to sort items by date / alphabetically / click and drag, etc.

-----------
Version 0.7
-----------

The application allows the user to remove projects and edit their names.

-----------
Version 0.6
-----------

The application now uses localstorage to store date when the window is closed.

-----------
Version 0.5
-----------

Code consolidated into appropriate modules, cleaned up.

-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

The application now works for projects added.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

The application now allows the user to switch between projects Today and This Week while storing what informatio

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------

Basic functionality has been added. The user can create new projects, click on them in the menu causing them to appear in the interface, and then add new items to the list. 

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

Most of the foundation is complete. New items can be added to the list and the interface functions as it should. Working on appending items to the current project and rendering them that way, and allowing the interface to change between projects.
